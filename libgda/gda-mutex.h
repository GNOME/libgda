 * @title: GdaMutex
 * @stability: Stable

 *
 * #GdaMutex implements a recursive mutex (unlike the #GMutex implementation which offers no
 * guarantee about recursiveness). A recursive mutex is a mutex which can be locked several
 * times by the same thread (and needs to be unlocked the same number of times before
 * another thread can lock it).
 *
 * A #GdaMutex can safely be used even in a non multi-threaded environment in which case
 * it does nothing.
