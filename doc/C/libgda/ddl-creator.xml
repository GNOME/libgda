  <title>Database generation from file and dumping to file</title>
  <para>
    Database can be generated/updated from an xml file and also dunped to an xml file. Is can be 
    done using <link linkend="GdaDdlCreator">GdaDdlCreator</link>, which provides essential 
    functionality for database manipulation. The existing database can be expanded. Foreign keys
    can't be added. This is a current limitation that should be resolved soon.
