<para>Note that virtual connections have some inherent limitations
  <footnote>
    <para>
      As virtual connections are implemented using 
      <ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=VirtualTables">SQLite's virtual table</ulink> features, 
      the SQL dialect which can be used
      is the SQLite one (see the <ulink url="http://sqlite.org/lang.html">SQL as Understood By SQLite</ulink> page), and
      there are a few limitations inherent to this implementation (see link for more information).
    </para>
    <para>
      Also note that it is possible to create temporary tables in virtual connections using "CREATE TEMP TABLE..." statements,
      but the contents of such tables will be lost once the connection is closed.
    </para>
  </footnote>due to the implementation.
